A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm in Python.


Introduction


The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption algorithm that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.


Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
- Supports custom shift values
- Handles uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetical characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.)



Code Explanation


The `https://github.com/Gabreezy/PRODIGY_CS_01` file contains two main functions:


- `encrypt(text, shift)`: Shifts each letter in the text by the specified shift value
- `decrypt(text, shift)`: Reverses the encryption process


Example Use Cases
- Secure communication: Use the Caesar Cipher to encrypt sensitive information
- Educational purposes: Demonstrate basic encryption concepts
